# MC-SkillPoints
A Minecraft mod that adds a skill and perk system to the game. This mod is very based off of my experiences playing Skyrim and Fallout. This mod is currently in its theoretical stage. It will add a very easy to use and fully-featured API for easy mod compatbility, as well as quick development of new features. 

Shoutout to kingluke_ (bae) for helping me with ideas and names, and showing me Skyrim and Fallout.

When complete, wiki will be available at the FTB Official Wiki/Gamepedia, at whatever name we decide to go with.

# About
## Skills
Each skill (described below) has its own skill tree, and can level up with use. Higher skill levels allow for the enabling of different perks, but also (depending on the skill) can make the game more difficult. Any perk can be chosen when the player levels up in that skill, but some can only be chosen at certain levels. There is a level cap of 100. Some perks have their own perk prequesites that are required to have before they can be chosen. Each skill has the same amount of perks.

When a player levels up, it will state in the chat "*user* has leveled up in the *skill* skill!" Stating this globally will be enabled by default, but disableable for large servers.

More skills may be added. Perks and skills are subject to different names and values. Names are not my strongest suit.
